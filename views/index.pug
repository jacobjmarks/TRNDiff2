            | TRNDiff is a node.js app which exists to support visual comparison of transcriptional
            | relationships across dozens or even hundreds of organisms. We use a simple, compact
            | 'wagon wheel' representation of the Transcriptional Regulatory Network (TRN), centred
            | on a single Transcription Factor (TF). Here the wagon wheel hub is the TF, and the
            | possible target genes (TGs) appear as nodes on the wheel rim. A regulatory
            | relationship is shown by a spoke between the hub and the node.

            | RegPrecise [
            a(href="http://regprecise.lbl.gov/RegPrecise/") http://regprecise.lbl.gov/RegPrecise/
            | ] is a repository of high-quality reference data which captures the regulatory
            | relationships between genes in 390 prokaryote genomes. The database contains manually
            | curated details of genes, transcription factors and transcription factor binding
            | sites which have been obtained by careful comparative genomic analysis,
            | experimentation and literature review as outlined in the paper:

            | TRNDiff is intended to provide an easy way to browse the RegPrecise database, locate
            | a regulog of interest, and view the regulons belonging to the regulog. Any regulog
            | can be saved to the desktop in CSV format, and these files can be edited and then
            | reloaded into the program to view the results.

            | Future versions of this application will provide further integration of TRNDiff and
            | RegPrecise with standard tools such as NCBI BLAST to allow users to execute more powerful workflows.
